# What is this?

This is a custom writer for [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to allow it to write
osis documents. It's intended to make it easier to create osis genbooks for
use with software based on [The SWORD Project](http://www.crosswire.org/).

Any format that can be read by pandoc can be converted into osis with this
custom writer.

*A better readme needs to be created.*
